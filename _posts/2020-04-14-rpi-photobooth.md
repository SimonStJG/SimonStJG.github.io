Super simple Photobooth for Raspberry Pi, controlled by hardware buttons.  I originally built this 
for my wedding party but ended up using it for a bunch of parties with friends as well.  Except
for the printer which has a tendency of jamming, it's proved surprisingly resilient!

You can read more about this and see some pictures on the [rpi-photobooth Github Repo](
