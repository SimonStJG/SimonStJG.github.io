Built using a Raspberry Pi and some large arcade buttons.  The buttons light up, and you have to hit the correct button
as quickly as possible.  It makes some silly nosies when you hit each button too.

The software and a bit of a write-up of how I built the hardware is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/SimonStJG/reactions).
