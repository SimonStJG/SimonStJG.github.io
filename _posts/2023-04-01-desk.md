I'll add some pictures when my desk is covered in another project, but for now I'd just like to make a note of what parts I used.

* Penny Wood Bespoke: Unfinished Table Top, Pine, 1400x600x32.
* Hairpin Leg Co: Box Hairpin Legs, 71cm
* Colron Refined Danish Oil, Natural.  Only because I had some lying around.
* Coo Var Yaucht and Seaplane Varnish, again because I had some lying around.  Went on thicker than I remember, I think it had been hanging around a bit too long!
