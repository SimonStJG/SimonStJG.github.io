In a previous life (2011 to 2014), I was a PhD student in Mathematics, my supervisor was [Brita Nucinkis](http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/brita-nucinkis(1256195e-d48e-4e83-bc02-c50d77ab01a9).html).  Having finished it two years ago, I've forgotten almost everything.  I'm pretty sure I used to describe myself as working in the intersection between algebra and topology, but in reality it was almost all algebraic, I never had the intuition for topology. 

[Pre-prints from the ArXiv](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/author/S.John-Green), all are now published or accepted for publication:

* Quasi-automorphisms of the infinite rooted 2-edge-coloured binary tree, accepted for publication with Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics.
* [Bredon-Poincar√© Duality Groups](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jgth.2014.17.issue-6/jgth-2014-0029/jgth-2014-0029.xml), Journal of Group Theory, 13 Jun 2014.
* [Cohomological finiteness conditions for Mackey and cohomological Mackey functors](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869314002324), Journal of Algebra, May 14, 2014.
* [On the Gorenstein and \\( \mathfrak{F} \\)-cohomological dimensions](http://blms.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/05/20/blms.bdu030), Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, Feb 18 2014.
* [Centralizers in Houghton's Groups](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-edinburgh-mathematical-society/article/div-classtitlecentralizers-in-houghtons-groupsdiv/8CBEA3DCA4F86A1EC27467AC74452F5B), Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, 13 June 2014.


And here is my thesis, [Cohomological Finiteness Properties of Groups](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1410.4363).

I'm also on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_St_John-Green).
