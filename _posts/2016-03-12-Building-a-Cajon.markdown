A [Cajón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n) is basically a huge wooden box which you sit on and then hit the front of to make a bass-y drum sound, or a snare-y sound if you put a snare in it.

# Design #

It's a glorified wooden box made of plywood with a snare inside.  The only important detail is that the front face needs to be made out of thinner plywood so it can act like the skin of a drum.

TODO

 * Work out what the exact dimensions are, including the widths of the plywood I used.

## Snare ##

To add a bit more breadth to the sound, I added a snare, like you'd stretch across a snare drum.  If you attach it so that it touches one side of the Cajón more than the other, then you can get varying sounds through playing the snare drum in different places.

    TODO pretty picture again of how I connected it.
