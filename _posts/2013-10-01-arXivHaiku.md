Haiku drawn from the arXiv, then published to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arxivhaiku) and to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arxivhaiku).  Sadly no longer active, because of my own laziness.

I wrote this long ago, before I was a Software developer for work and was still a PhD student.  I had another github handle then, and you can find the code [there](https://github.com/Schottkey/arXivHaiku).   Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Don't judge my efforts too harshly.

Here are some tweets from when it was live:
