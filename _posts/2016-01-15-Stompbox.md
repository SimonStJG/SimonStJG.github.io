This project didn't really work at all, but maybe I'll try again sometime and give this story some closure.

# What is it? #

A wooden box you stamp on to make a bass-y sound, because I want to sound just like Seasick Steve when I play the guitar.

## The plan ##

    *------------*
    |  Mic in a  |----------| Low Pass Filter |-----------| Amplifier |----- etc
    |    box     |
    *------------*

## Attempt 1 ##

A small box built from some wood I found in a skip.  Inside it, a bit of an old speaker, wired together with the [simplest possible low-pass filter](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html).

       +        R
    \ | -----\/\/\/------*---------
    | |                  = C       Output
    / | -----------------*---------
       -

Tried to wire it through my pre-amp (an Alesis mic duo - advertised as having "high impedance" inputs, probably 1 -> 2 kOhms).  The low-pass filter does make an impact, but with or without it there is a lot of white noise, probably because a bit of old speaker doesn't provide enough signal.

## Attempt 2 ##

The same small box, built from skip-wood, but now with a PCB mounted electret microphone and a [wonderfully simple circuit](http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/microphone_powering.html):

        +---------------------------- battery +ve (3 to 12 Volts)
        |
       2k2 R1
        |
        o---------- 10uF ------o----- output
        |+                     |
     CAPSULE                  10k R2
        |-                     |
        +----------------------o----- GND, and battery -ve

This gives a much deeper background noise but still far too much of it.  Perhaps because the output impedance is basically determined by R2, so probably around 10 times higher than the input impedance of my pre-amp, which is a [bad thing](https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan03/articles/impedanceworkshop.asp).

## Attempt 3 ##

Time to try an [op amp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier), there's a [wealth of information](http://123.physics.ucdavis.edu/week_1_files/opamps.pdf) about these all over the internet.  I've chosen [this one](https://lowvoltage.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/lm358-mic-amp/) because it's simple enough for me to understand the entire thing, and because I had an LM358 hanging around from another failed electronics project from years ago (there's a theme here).

I've added

* A 100Ohm resistor and a 100k log pot, both in series with the output.  Without the 100R resistor, there was far too much gain with headphones and the op-amp would oscillate wildly, the 100k pot acts as a volume control.
* [Battery protection diode](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva139/slva139.pdf), power-on LED, and switch.

# Adding an active low pass #

It's [pretty easy](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_5.html) to add a low pass filter to a standard inverting amplifier circuit like the one above - you add a capacitor C in parallel with the resistor R on the feedback loop between the inverting input and the output.  The larger the impedance, the higher the gain.  At high frequencies, the impedance of the capacitor [is very high](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_1.html) so the impedance of R and C in parallel is close to C, and there is a lot of gain.  At lower frequencies the impedance of R and C is close to R, since the impedance of C is so high, so there is less gain.

At 86k and 15nF [the cut-off is about](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_5.html) 123Hz, which is near-enough an octave below [middle C](http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html).

# Making it bassier #

The de-coupling capacitors as they stand (10u between mic and 358 and 220u between 358 and output) currently form high pass filters (see previous section for the maths).  For example at 20Hz, which is lowest frequency my microphone claims to be able to pick up, the resistance of the 10u capacitor is

$$ X_f = (2 * pi * f * C)^-1 ~= 800 \Omega $$

Which approaches the vlaue of the 1K resistor it's in series with.

Just to be sure, raise these capacitors, \\( 10\mu \rightarrow 220\mu \\) and \\( 220\mu \rightarrow 1000\mu \\).

# Next attempt #

Perhaps use [Bass pickups](http://diyguitar.ca/diy-gears/p-bass-stomp-box/) in an isolated box?
