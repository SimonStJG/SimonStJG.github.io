A machine with four light up buttons in a pretty box. It reminds you to do certain tasks, like water the plants, on a set schedule.  You do have to remember which light means "water the plants" though.  And, it was an excuse to learn some rust.

Some more details, like code and very simple circuit diagrams [on GitHub](https://github.com/SimonStJG/fourbuttons).
