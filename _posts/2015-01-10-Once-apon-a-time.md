"Choose your own adventure" style game, basic template available [here](/raw/once-upon-a-time/#/)

My first foray into [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [on Github](https://github.com/SimonStJG/once-apon-a-time).  Originally a choose-your-own-adventure story I made about a friend, and then another friend, but I've now anonymised it (it wasn't the sort of thing which is acceptable to leave on the internet).

With hindsight, I made a number of mistakes here, including not pinning my dependencies properly, which meant I spent a fun hour getting it to build again while preparing it for this website.  The complexity of the build process for Javascript apps seems phenominal.  The build process for this was nicked from [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), which was great until it broke, and I spent a lot of time simplifying it until I could find the bug in a dependancy.
