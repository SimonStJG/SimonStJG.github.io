Table made out of rather cheap wood from B&Q and very pretty hairpin legs from [the hairpin leg company](https://www.thehairpinlegcompany.co.uk/).  Won't bother with a diagram as it's pretty self-explanatory!

Materials were:

* Redwood, planed all round ~20x170 wide.
* Heavy duty table legs from  [the hairpin leg company](https://www.thehairpinlegcompany.co.uk/)
* Danish Oil, but only because I had some in the cupboard.  Time will tell if I should've varnished it.

I did overestimate how much weight the wood could withstand without bowing, so had to add some more legs in the center, see the picture at the base for how it originally looked.
