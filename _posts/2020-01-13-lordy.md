This was my first project working with a raspberry pi.  I fitted it inside an old
yellow rotary dial phone which I found in a vintage shop.  When you pick up the 
receiver it will play you a bit of the Lord of the Rings - or potentially other 
audio book of your choice - but what better audio books are there?

I don't have any notes or internal pictures, but then there wasn't much electronics 
required!  The "handset raised" switch feeds into a Raspberry Pi GPIO input and the
audio output goes to the existing speaker in the handset.  The code is available 
[here on GitHub](https://github.com/SimonStJG/OhLordy.), though it's not much to look at!
