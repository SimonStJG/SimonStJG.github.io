A [Cajón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n) is basically a huge wooden box which you sit on and then hit the front of to make a bass-y drum sound, or a snare-y sound if you put a snare in it.

# Design #

It's a glorified wooden box made of plywood with a snare inside.  The only important detail is that the front face needs to be made out of thinner plywood so it can act like the skin of a drum.

All faces except for the front face were made of *TODO* mm birch plywood, and the front face was made of *TODO* mm plywood, you can see how it all fits together in the pictures below.

I finished it with spray paint, teak oil, and some small rubber feet.  There was a bit of a problem with this, in that the teak oil caused the spray paint to blur a tiny bit at the edges, but it wasn't catastrophic.

## Snare ##

To add a bit more breadth to the sound, I added a snare, like you'd stretch across a snare drum.  If you attach it so that it touches one side of the Cajón more than the other, then you can get varying sounds through playing the snare drum in different places.
