My first foray into [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [on Github](https://github.com/SimonStJG/once-apon-a-time).  Originally a choose-your-own-adventure story I made about a friend, and then another friend, but I've now anonymised it (it wasn't the sort of thing which is acceptable to leave on the internet).

With hindsight, I made a number of mistakes here, including not pinning my dependencies properly, which meant I spent a fun hour getting it to build again while preparing it for this website.  The complexity of the build process for Javascript apps can be phenominal, I nicked my build process from [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), which is great until it breaks.
