My old website is [still available here](/raw/old-website/main/), and the academic one I had before that is [here](/raw/old-website/main/academic/index.html), I wrote both of those by hand in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  For a while my homepage was this [ASCII art picture of an old radio](/raw/empty-website/index.html).
