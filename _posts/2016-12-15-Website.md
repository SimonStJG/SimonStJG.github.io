I made a website (you're on it).

While doing so, I remember why I dislike HTML/CSS, the feeling that everything is just a series of hacks (so much trickery required just to center some text vertically).

My old website is [still available here](/raw/old-website/main/), and the academic one I had before that is [here](/raw/old-website/main/academic/index.html), I wrote both of those by hand in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ~~I'm not convinced it's quicker doing it with Jekyll~~, it definitely isn't any quicker, I'm reminded of [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
