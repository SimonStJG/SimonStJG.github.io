TODO - Get a new picture for this!

In a previous life (2011 to 2014), I was a PhD student in Mathematics, my supervisor was [Brita Nucinkis](http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/brita-nucinkis(1256195e-d48e-4e83-bc02-c50d77ab01a9).html).  Having finished it two years ago, I've forgotten almost everything, but I'm pretty sure I used to describe myself as working in the intersection between algebra and topology. 

[Pre-prints from the ArXiv](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/author/S.John-Green), all are now published:

* TODO Fill out this bit!

And here is [my thesis](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1410.4363).
