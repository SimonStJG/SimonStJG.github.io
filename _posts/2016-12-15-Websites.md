I made a website (you're on it).

While doing so, I remembered why I dislike HTML/CSS, the feeling that everything is just a series of hacks (so much trickery required just to center some text vertically, or to make a grid which resizes with the width of the page).

My old website is [still available here](/raw/old-website/main/), and the academic one I had before that is [here](/raw/old-website/main/academic/index.html), I wrote both of those by hand in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  For this one, I've jumped on the static site generator bandwagon and used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  I'm not convinced it's quicker, although it's definitely quicker to add new pages and to keep styles consistent.
