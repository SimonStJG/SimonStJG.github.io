Haiku drawn automatically from the arXiv, then published to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arxivhaiku) and to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arxivhaiku).

Before I was a Software developer, I was still a PhD student and I wrote this then.  You can find the code [there](https://github.com/Schottkey/arXivHaiku), under my old github handle.   Sadly this no longer active, because of my own laziness.  One day I may resurrect it, but it will be a struggle not to refactor the whole thing.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

Here are some tweets from when it was live:
