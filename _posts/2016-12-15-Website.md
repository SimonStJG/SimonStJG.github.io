I made a website (you're on it).

While doing so, I remember why I dislike HTML layouts, I fear this will be forever unfinished.

My old website is [still available here](/raw/old-website/main/), I wrote that one by hand in HTML CSS and JS, ~~I'm not convinced it's quicker doing it with Jekyll~~, it definitely isn't any quicker, I'm reminded of [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/): 
>  .. Explicit is better than implicit. 
>  Simple is better than complex...
